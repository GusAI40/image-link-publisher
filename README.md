## üõ†Ô∏è What's Inside This App

### Main Files You Should Know About

- **`app/page.tsx`** - The main page where users upload images
- **`components/image-upload.tsx`** - The drag-and-drop upload area
- **`components/markdown-output.tsx`** - Shows the generated markdown code
- **`app/api/upload/route.ts`** - Handles saving images to the cloud
- **`app/api/describe-image/route.ts`** - Uses AI to describe images

### Database Tables

- **`uploaded_images`** - Stores information about each uploaded image
- **`storage.objects`** - Supabase's built-in table that holds the actual image files

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Upload failed" Error
- **Check your internet connection** - Large images need good internet
- **Try smaller images** - Each image must be under 10MB
- **Check file type** - Only JPG, PNG, GIF, and WebP images work

### "Database connection failed" Error
- **Check your Supabase setup** - Make sure your database is running
- **Run the setup scripts** - You might have missed creating the database tables
- **Check environment variables** - Your database connection info might be wrong

### Images won't load
- **Wait a few seconds** - Sometimes it takes time for images to process
- **Check the image URL** - Copy and paste it in a new browser tab
- **Try uploading again** - Sometimes uploads fail silently

### AI descriptions aren't working
- **Check your AI integration** - Make sure Grok is connected in your project settings
- **Try again later** - AI services sometimes have temporary issues
- **Check the console** - Look for error messages in your browser's developer tools

## üé® Customizing Your App

### Change Colors
Edit `app/globals.css` to change the app's colors:
\`\`\`css
:root {
  --primary: oklch(0.506 0.17 162.581); /* Main green color */
  --secondary: oklch(0.588 0.15 162.581); /* Lighter green */
}
\`\`\`

### Change Upload Limits
Edit `app/page.tsx` to change how many files or how big they can be:
\`\`\`tsx
<ImageUpload
  maxFiles={20}  // Allow 20 files instead of 10
  maxFileSize={20 * 1024 * 1024}  // Allow 20MB instead of 10MB
/>
\`\`\`

### Add Your Own Branding
Edit the header in `app/page.tsx`:
\`\`\`tsx
<h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-foreground">Your Company Name</h1>
<p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground max-w-2xl mx-auto">
  Your custom description here
</p>
